# hello-world
My first correct GitHub project
My name is Christian Tisby, and I'm an aspiring web developer.  I'll be glad when I can say that I'm an actual developer.  That is my prayer and my goal.  I'm thankful for Team Treehouse and Codecademy for helping me along on this journey.  Much appreciated.
